# JustJSON
The best frontend framework based on the best file format. 

Why bother with messy HTML, CSS, or JavaScript when you can build entire websites using only **JSON**? Say goodbye to the tyranny of traditional web development and say hello to the simplicity of objects and arrays!


## Description
Are you tired of learning multiple languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Do you feel overwhelmed by the modern frontend ecosystem, with its endless layers of abstraction and package managers? I know you do. That's why I built **JustJSON**‚Äîthe framework that compiles pure JSON into an entire website.

Now you can finally build your dream website with *just* JSON! Who needs JSX, templating languages, or even a browser? JustJSON is so revolutionary, you don‚Äôt even need to know what a browser is! If you‚Äôre smart enough to write JSON, you‚Äôre smart enough to write **everything**.


It is so good, yet so simple, you will wonder how come no one thought of this before. You're welcome.

## Features

- üí™ **Frontend in JSON**: One file format to rule them all!
- üî• **Performance**: Caring about performance in web development is an anti-pattern, just get the feature out ASAP with JustJSON!
- üõ†Ô∏è **No learning curve**: If you know how to make a JSON file, congratulations‚Äîyou already mastered JustJSON!
- ü•á **Best practices**: Yes, you will practice JSON all the time.
